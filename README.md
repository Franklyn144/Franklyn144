- 👋 Hi, I’m @Franklyn144. I'm fresh to the world of programming. I've chosen to start with HTML and go on to CSS and JavaScript afterwards.
I'll keep a progress log. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to enter the blockchain industry because I think it's where the world is going.
